# Frog Game

A simple frog game made with Python and Pygame. The goal is to eat all the flies while avoiding birds, then escape under the lily pad.

This is a small project I created in Spring 2025 as part of my learning process.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install Pygame if you donâ€™t have it already:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
4. Download or clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/westolt/frog-game.git
```
## How to Play
* Use arrow keys to move the frog.
* Eat all the flies (10 total) to unlock the lily pad.
* Avoid the birds, or you will lose.
* Reach the lily pad to win the game.

## Controls
* Arrow keys -> Move the frog
* F2 -> Start a new game
* Esc -> Exit the game
